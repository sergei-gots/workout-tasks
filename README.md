<h2>To find closest transitive differences between items of 3 arrays</h2>

 We should implement the method which accepts 3 arrays of numbers as arguments
 and returns array with the 3 numbers - by one for one of the arrays so that
 they represent the most minimal difference from all the possible variants,
 ant the third number should be within that range inclusively if such a third number exist
 Order of numbers in the result is not considered as important.
